This repository contains my implementation of useful data structures, algorithms, and programs, as well as my solutions to programming puzzles. There are detailed explanations of each question included in the solution files for the programming puzzles. 

Typically, the question is accompanied by an indication of where the question originated, e.g. Leetcode, Hackerank, etc. All of the solutions are thoroughly tested to ensure correctness, and I provide commentary to explain how my solution works. 

This is to help readers understand the code better and to enable them to apply the same concepts to similar problems.

The solutions were written in Python 3 in accordance with the PEP style guide.

I would like to express my thanks to Chip Huyen (@chiphuyen) who provided inspiration for this.
